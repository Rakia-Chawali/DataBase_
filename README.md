SQL vs NoSQL: "Five Main Differences"

SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

There are five practical differences between SQL and NoSQL:
1-Language
2-Scalability
3-Structure
4-Properties
5-Support and communities
